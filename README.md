*A quick way to learn Mandarin Chinese pronunciations*

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.recursivecorruption.kuai&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>

The first and most important step in learning a language is to learn the pronunciation. This tool provides a simple and fast UI to test yourself, improve, and learn Chinese's pinyin spelling system, syllable pronunciations, and tones. The app works as follows:

 - You are given a random chinese  syllable
 - You must transcribe it using pinyin
 - You can replay the audio sample as many times as you'd like

If this is your first time with the character system, [the following few videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwnMJpcMKuIoG-YfTaGjmVBMLyVYkL6Cf) are *infinitely valuable* in teaching the basics. After that, you're ready to start using the app.
